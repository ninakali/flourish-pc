# flourish pc

This project aims to create an open framework for personal computing. Cheap, simple, yet practical.

## why?

Two main reasons.

First, it seems [the winter](http://collapseos.org/why.html) is coming. Some projects aim to preserve and bootstrap knowledge about computer operating systems. We want to make sure to preserve personal computing hardware that runs things like Collapse OS.

Second, in many places on this planet __the spring__ has never come in the first place. Even in countries where computer-like devices are common, they usually cannot be used for general-purpose computing easily, nor can they be hacked/repurposed without extensive know-how. One might argue that the adventure of under-$1 powerful ARM chips and easy-to-hack devices like Arduino has made personal computing affordable and straightforward. But unfortunately, one still needs a PC to flash the Arduino.

## so, what are you going to do about it?

Suppose Collapse OS is a framework for making bootable OS for scavenge-friendly platforms. In that case, Flourish PC is a framework for building a useful personal computing device using elements one has at hand. Therefore, it's less about specific solutions (though we are planning to provide you with multiple reference implementations) and more about sharing the know-how required for building a computer.

It is challenging to decide what the framework should include, though. For example, should we cover topics ranging from "you have a stick and a stone" to "now we finally produced electron tubes/semiconductor devices"? Probably not; we believe there must be better sources of knowledge regarding those essential-for-preserving-civilization topics. But on the other hand, basic knowledge about digital electronics is necessary for building a computer so we will include a primer on this topic.

## structure of the project

The __src__ directory is for the framework: documentation in Markdown format, schematics and code in source and target formats (for instance, kicad+png).

The __tools__ directory is for tools needed to convert the sources of the framework into release formats. We strive to make this framework maximally portable by providing plain-text (7-bit ASCII) and print-at-home versions.

The __blobs__ directory is for files used in this file.
