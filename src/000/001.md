# Flourish PC for frugal and affordable personal computing

Mass-production brought cheap smartphones and feature phones to everyone. According to Statista, today (in 2022), 91% of the world's population owns a relatively powerful portable computing device. Could these computing devices be used for personal computing? The answer is most probably "No".

## A personal phone is not a personal computer
The problem here lies in the fact that those devices are not multi-purpose devices and often cannot be repurposed. Usually, self-hosting software engineering tools, tools for electrical and mechanical design, databases and even access to the digital libraries are limited or absent from these platforms. In addition, the device's interfacing options and range of peripherals can be very limited, too.

Let's say no general-purpose computing devices are lying around. What does it mean?
* Options for education and research are going to be severely limited.
* Anything but simple mechanical and electrical designs will be unattainable or very expensive.
* Self-replicating technologies like 3D printers are beyond your reach.

There are at least three options to consider in such a situation.

## Let's turn a phone into a personal computer
Depending on your phone model and your access to the Internet, you might be able to convert your device into a personal computer by replacing your phone's software and connecting it to various peripheral devices. We are going to cover possible options in a separate chapter. But do not keep your hopes too high: chances are you might need to build a computing device to interface with the CPU in your phone to make it genuinely general-purpose.

## Let's build a very cheap personal computer
It is possible to get a cheap CPU module for a general-purpose personal computer for under $5. But to make it useable, one would need to invest much more money into peripheral devices, including the basic ones.

## Let's scavenge the parts to make a personal computer
Plenty of commonly-used computer parts can be scavenged from broken or discarded electronic devices.
