# Flourish PC for salvage and collapse computing

## Salvage computing
It might be that your circumstances do not allow you to buy computers or their parts. If that is the case, you will need to find and extract the parts you need from things you can find lying around. As we mentioned in the previous section, if you are lucky enough, you might be able to nail a pretty powerful computer from scraps.


## "Collapse computing" aka _Surely you're joking?_

If humanity takes the wrong turn, our technological advances could be lost. While personal computing, in most cases, is not essential for the survival of individuals, we consider personal computing quite crucial for the survival of our species.

We understand that the risk of an immediate collapse of computing is probably minuscule. We also know that the chances that this particular framework will be widespread enough to be helpful in such a situation are meagre. We also understand that for significant risks present, humanity has countermeasures in place, and we can hope those will work.

This document is one of the final countermeasures. In the improbable situation that the technology has collapsed, yet this framework somehow survived, we hope that this framework and our notes might help speed up the recovery of lost technologies.

## "Sudden crisis" scenarios aka _Yet another conspiracy?_

While collecting an exhaustive list of realistic threats to computing is not a goal of this project, we think it's still important to voice our concerns. We also provided a few examples of events that, in our opinion, indicate that such threats are not hollow. You might find those in the "External links" section below.

* Most advanced computer technologies are proprietary. A targeted attack on such a technology might cause a falling dominoes effect. Permanent damage to strategically important plants such as TSMC and Intel might leave the planet without essential chips.
* A war or a natural disaster might cut off an entire country's access to information and imports.
* An economic crisis might leave you without digital components for your cars, tractors and factories.
* A planet-scale catastrophe similar to Carrington Event at scale could disrupt global supply and production chains so severely that the whole civilisation will collapse.
