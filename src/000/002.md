# Flourish PC for salvage and collapse computing

## "Sudden crisis" scenarios
While collecting an exhaustive list of realistic threats to computing is not a goal of this project, we think it's essential to provide at least some examples. You might find those in the "External links" section below. Naturally, there are countermeasures to these threats. But what if these countermeasures fail?

* Most advanced computer technologies are proprietary. A targeted attack on such a technology might cause a falling dominoes effect. Permanent damage to strategically important plants such as TSMC and Intel might leave the planet without essential chips.
* A war or a natural disaster might cut off an entire country's access to information and imports.
* An economic crisis might leave you without digital components for your cars, tractors and factories.
* A planet-scale catastrophe similar to Carrington Event at scale could disrupt global supply and production chains so severely that the whole civilisation will collapse.
