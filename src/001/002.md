# Hazards you should know about

There are hazards and risks beyond electric trauma and low mood that might face you on your journey of building a computer. It is essential to know about them and prepare accordingly.

### Heat sources
You will likely need a soldering iron or another heat source for the electrical engineering of your computer. The soldering iron tip is usually as hot as 300-600 C. That is enough for many materials, including cloth, grease and paper, to catch fire. Therefore, do not leave your soldering equipment unattended. Always make sure that it is powered off when you are not working.

### Heated parts
The soldering iron will heat the parts you are soldering. It will make everything that iron touches, especially metals, very hot. Electric components, wires, soldering iron's tip, and your circuit board will all be hot enough to burn you.

### Electric current
The electric current produces heat. In fact, most of the energy computers use is converted into heat. It is normal for most computer devices to heat up to 45-70C (~113-158F); some power-hungry devices might get hotter than boiling water under normal conditions. Be aware that heat pads and the parts you are using might give you burns.

Sometimes the electronics you use might get out of normal conditions. For example, a faulty component or incorrect power supply might result in a current much higher than expected to flow through your board. Suppose the components won't be able to dissipate heat quickly enough. In that case, they can easily get beyond the ignition temperature of components themselves or parts around them. This might result in a fire. Therefore, please do not leave your electronics unattended. Use circuit breakers and fuses to limit the current drawn from the power supply.

### Batteries, especially lithium ones
Batteries store a lot of energy inside, especially lithium ones. Never short circuit them, and make sure they won't get short-circuited by accident due to contact with metals or corrosion caused by water. Some batteries swell with usage; those are especially dangerous, as they might explode. Please dispose of them (responsibly). Bottom line: batteries, especially ones containing lithium, can cause a nasty fire that will require special equipment to put out.

### Extinguishing a fire on your desk/workbench
If there is a fire around electronics, **never use water** to extinguish it. Turn off the power supply and cut off the circuit breaker if it is safe to do so. Call your emergency services. If you plan to have fires often _(ha-ha),_ invest in fire equipment.
