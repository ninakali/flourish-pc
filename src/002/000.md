# Things you will need

The more tools at hand you have, the easier your task of building a computer will be. There is an approximate list of things you will almost surely need.

## Circuitry and components
There are many types of computing components you can use. Some, like microcontroller units and SoCs, can be an almost complete computer as one integrated component. Some might require a lot of supporting components to work. You might want to go as far as making your own key components, but in this case, the task of building a computer is likely going to take a while.

### You can't do electronics without this
* Power source (ideally both 3.3V and 5V)
* Jumper wires (lots)
* Resistors (a handful)
* A voltmeter

If you can find diodes, capacitors and transistors, then great.

### Your computing module
You might consider a few options. It is okay to keep things theoretical for now, and decide on your computing module later, when you will be able to make a more informed decision.

#### MCU (microcontroller) or SoC (system-on-chip) solution
Easy. Cheap. Slow. Need know-how and documentation.

Upsides:
* One chip will solve most of the tasks you need it to solve.
* Can be as cheap as a few cents.
* Possible to salvage from broken household electronics.

Downsides:
* If you lack documentation for the chip, you might be unable to do anything useful with it.
* Often come in packages so small it's unrealistic to solder by hand
* Might require a computer (or even a proprietary device) to program
* Low specs

#### CPU-on-chip
Moderately hard. Moderately expensive. Can be powerful. Some models are widespread. Need know-how, but less.

Upsides:
* General-purpose CPU chips are usually reasonably powerful.
* Some CPUs are widespread and quite universal, for instance, i8080, 6502, and Z80.
* Require very little tribal knowledge to start working with.

Downsides:
* Advanced CPUs can not be soldered by hand and require even more know-how than MCUs.
* Simpler models deliver less performance per $ compared with MCUs.
* Require extra components.

#### Custom CPU made with logic chips
Moderately hard. Somewhat expensive. Slow.

Upsides:
* You have complete control over your computer and its features.
* Does not require any manufacturer-specific knowledge.
* The level of complexity of the circuitry is comparable with advanced single-chip CPU computers

Downsides:
* Lots of (cheap) components not only raise the computer's cost but also increase the number of potential fault points.
* It is going to be hard to balance performance versus computer complexity. A simple computer will be slow; a fast one will be tough to make.

#### Custom CPU made with non-IC components
Very hard. Very expensive. Slow. Can be built from things lying around or made in a garage.

Upsides:
* Full control over your computer.
* Can use whatever components you find or, indeed, produce.

Downsides:
* No matter what components you choose, it will be very slow.
* It is likely to be unreliable.
* Extremely complicated to build and use.

### Your input-output modules
The most basic input/output modules are:
* A button (which can be made out of wire),
* A light source (a small lightbulb or an LED),
* A buzzer (an earpiece).

This is the bare minimum. The sky is the limit.

## Montage method

### Breadboard route
If you have access to hobbyist electronics shops, it might be easier to experiment with building computers using a breadboard. In that case, you will need DIP-packaged components, and your jumper wires should have connectors you could use with your board.


### Protoboards, PCBs and point-to-point soldering route
Things will be somewhat more challenging if you:
* want to scale your solutions,
* make them more reliable, or
* if you must rely on salvaging components to build your computer.

On the upside, you might be able to use a broader range of components, including SMD (surface-mounted components).

You will need:
* A board you can use for circuitry. It can be a custom PCB, a prototyping board, or even just a piece of insulating material to place the components on for point-to-point soldering
* Soldering kit: soldering iron, solder, and flux are the bare minimum. Desoldering pump and braid, heat gun, oven and so on can make your life easier.
* Personal protective equipment is something you should consider having, too.
