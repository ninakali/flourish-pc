# B
#### Binary
1. Related to a system of numbers with the base of 2, or represented in such a system
2. A computer program stored in an internal for a given computer format

#### Bit
In computing theory, the most basic unit of digital information that can represent only two states: "0" and "1", or "Yes" and "No", and so on. The name comes from "binary digit".

#### Boot
Also see: _bootstrapping_
A process of starting a computer's operating system, usually from the point where computer itself isn't fully operational to the point when the operating system can be used.

#### Bootstrapping
A process of starting something that can continue to operate or improve without external input. Often it means "a success in building a self-hosting environment". Examples of things that might need bootstrapping are operating systems, compilers, and computers themselves.

#### Byte
1. A unit of digital information. In the modern sense, one byte equals eight bit. Originally meant "number of bits required to encode a single character of text"
2. Eight bit of information.

# C
#### Code
1. In a broader sense, a way of representing information, especially in a format computer can understand. Numbers, words, graphics, music and a great many other things can be encoded in a format suitable for computer calculations.
2. In a more specific sense, an internal representation of a computer program.

#### Compiler

#### Computer
A device (a tool) that can follow a set of instructions to perform complex calculations on numbers or encoded information.

# D
#### Digital
Also see: _code_
1. A representation of anything when encoded in numbers. E.g., a text can be encoded with digits representing the index number of the letters. In this code, "Hello" is "8 5 12 12 15".
2. Related to a numerical representation of anything. E.g., digital photography - photography that uses numerical representations of photographs)

#### Driver
A computer program that tells your computer how to communicate with a specific connected device.

# E
#### Emulation
Running a program designed for a different system through means of simulating parts of that system.

# F
#### File
Digitally encoded information that was assigned a name and is stored in a computer.

#### Firmware
1. A computer program provided by the computer's manufacturer and stored inside in its read-only memory (ROM).
2. Any computer program stored in ROM.

#### FLASH
A type of computer memory and/or long-term data storage. A type of ROM that allows thousands (often more) erase-write cycle and can be rewritten partially. Rewrites are possible when performed in small blocks, which allows simulation of RAM's behaviour.

# H
#### Hardware
Electrical and mechanical components of a computer.

# I
#### Interpreter

# O
#### Operating system

# P
#### Permacomputing

#### Personal computing

#### Program

# R
#### RAM
Random-access memory. A type of computer memory. The information stored in RAM can be accessed in any desired order and can be changed at will. The most common types of RAM usually lose the information stored in them when they are powered off. A variety of RAM that _doesn't_ lose its information when powered off is usually specifically marked Non-Volatile, or NV RAM.

#### ROM
Read-only memory. A type of computer memory. The information stored in RAM usually can be accessed in any order, but cannot be changed under normal circumstances. Unlike RAM, it does not lose the information stored inside when powered off. Many types of ROM can be erased (emptied) and programmed anew; those are called EPROM and EEPROM. A special type of ROM called FLASH (see _FLASH_) can be erased partially.

# S
#### Self-hosting
Also see: _bootstrapping_.
A tool (especially a compiler) that can be used for producing a new copies of itself.
