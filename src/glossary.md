# A
#### ALU
ALU, or Arithmetic logic unit, is a device that can perform mathematical and logical operations. Usually it is a part of a central processor.

# B
#### Binary
1. Related to a system of numbers with the base of 2, or represented in such a system
2. A computer program stored in an internal for a given computer format

#### Bit
In computing theory, the most basic unit of digital information that can represent only two states: "0" and "1", or "Yes" and "No", and so on. The name comes from "binary digit".

#### Boot
Also see: _bootstrapping_
A process of starting a computer's operating system, usually from the point where computer itself isn't fully operational to the point when the operating system can be used.

#### Bootstrapping
A process of starting something that can continue to operate or improve without external input. Often it means "a success in building a self-hosting environment". Examples of things that might need bootstrapping are operating systems, compilers, and computers themselves.

#### Breadboard
Also see: _PCB_
A board used for connecting electrical components together in a way that usually does not require soldering.

#### Byte
1. A unit of digital information. In the modern sense, one byte equals eight bit. Originally meant "number of bits required to encode a single character of text"
2. Eight bit of information.

# C
#### Code
1. In a broader sense, a way of representing information, especially in a format computer can understand. Numbers, words, graphics, music and a great many other things can be encoded in a format suitable for computer calculations.
2. In a more specific sense, an internal representation of a computer program.

#### Compiler
A tool for programming languages: a program that converts code in a form that can be understood by a programmer into a code that can be understood by a computer (usually, binary code).

#### Computer
A device (a tool) that can follow a set of instructions to perform complex calculations on numbers or encoded information.

### CPU
Also see: _ALU_, _register_
Central Processing Unit, the heart of a computer. Usually consists of an ALU, command decoder and a set of registers. Most commonly, implemented as a single chip, but does not have to be.

# D
#### Digital
Also see: _code_
1. A representation of anything when encoded in numbers. E.g., a text can be encoded with digits representing the index number of the letters. In this code, "Hello" is "8 5 12 12 15".
2. Related to a numerical representation of anything. E.g., digital photography - photography that uses numerical representations of photographs)

#### DIP
Also see: _SMD_
"Dual in-line package", a common package for chips, with two lines of pins on the sides of the chip, that can be mounted to the board using through-holes or sockets. Due to fairly large distance between pins (2.54mm), it is the easiest type of chips to work with as a hobbyist.

#### Driver
A computer program that tells your computer how to communicate with a specific connected device.

# E
#### Emulation
Running a program designed for a different system through means of simulating parts of that system.

# F
#### File
Digitally encoded information that was assigned a name and is stored in a computer.

#### Firmware
1. A computer program provided by the computer's manufacturer and stored inside in its read-only memory (ROM).
2. Any computer program stored in ROM.

#### FLASH
A type of computer memory and/or long-term data storage. A type of ROM that allows thousands (often more) erase-write cycle and can be rewritten partially. Rewrites are possible when performed in small blocks, which allows simulation of RAM's behaviour.

#### Flux
Chemical that cleans metals from dirt and rust during soldering. The most common type of flux is rosin flux, made of pine tree resin. 

# H
#### Hardware
Electrical and mechanical components of a computer.

# I
#### IC
Integrated circuit. A hardware component that contains many electronic (and sometimes mechanic or magnetic) components inside. Digital computing chips are a type of IC.

#### Interpreter
A tool for programming languages: a program that can execute code in a form that can understood by a programmer without converting it into machine code.

# M
#### Microcontroller, also known as MCU
A single-chip computer, normally for industrial purposes. Can be found in common appliances.

# O
#### Operating system
A computer program that provides a set of useful functions for controlling the computer, and is used to execute and set up other programs.

# P
#### PCB
Also see: _breadboard_.
Printed circuit board. A sandwich-like structure of conductive and insulating layers. It is used for attaching components and connecting them electrically.

#### Permacomputing
An approach to computing that aims to make computing sustainable.

#### Personal computing
A multi-purpose (and repurposable) computer that is small and cheap enough to be used individually. Example: PDAs (personal digital assistants) are repurposable pocket computers; therefore, they are a kind of personal computer. Counter-example: very similar to PDAs, digital organisers are multi-purpose computers, but they cannot be repurposed; hence, they aren't really personal computers.

#### Program
1. _noun_ a series of steps that a computer needs to perform to achieve a goal
2. _noun_ a file that contains a program in a format that can be executed by the computer (called "binary executable" in this case) or interpreted or compiled (called "source code" in this case)
3. _verb_ an action of recording a program into a ROM or Flash memory of a digital device

# R
#### RAM
Random-access memory. A type of computer memory. The information stored in RAM can be accessed in any desired order and can be changed at will. The most common types of RAM usually lose the information stored in them when they are powered off. A variety of RAM that _doesn't_ lose its information when powered off is usually specifically marked Non-Volatile, or NV RAM.

#### Register
Quickly-accessible memory inside a processor. A register's capacity is usually very low (1-16 bytes), and the number of registers inside a CPU is fairly small (2-256 registers).

#### ROM
Read-only memory. A type of computer memory. The information stored in RAM usually can be accessed in any order, but cannot be changed under normal circumstances. Unlike RAM, it does not lose the information stored inside when powered off. Many types of ROM can be erased (emptied) and programmed anew; those are called EPROM and EEPROM. A special type of ROM called FLASH (see _FLASH_) can be erased partially.

# S
#### Self-hosting
Also see: _bootstrapping_.
A tool (especially a compiler) that can be used for producing a new copies of itself.

#### SMD
Also see: _DIP_.
Surface-mounted device. That means that this electronic component is attached to the _PCB_ with soldering only. This usually means that the component is small, with the distance between pins as small as 0.5mm. SOP, SOIC, SSOP, TSOP, TSSOP are all types of SMD chips.

#### SoC
System-on-Chip, a complete computer implemented on a single chip. The exact contents of the system depend on the chip.

#### Software
Also see: _program_ (2).
A general term for computer programs.
