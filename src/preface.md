# Preface: Flourish PC and permacomputing

Computers have changed human civilisation. We depend on them, as we use them in almost every aspect of our daily lives and production cycles.

## We waste our limited resources with computers...
Today, in 2022, it is not uncommon to use tiny computers to power toothbrushes, pregnancy tests and even single-use train tickets.
The most commonly used RFID ticket, according to [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/10/20/96275/how-smart-is-a-smart-card/), probably has more computational power than the first commercially successful personal computer, Altair 8800.

The way we use more powerful computers has changed over the years, too. These days, a modest smartphone with eight cores @ 1.8GHz and 2 GB RAM is barely enough for routine tasks, despite being five times faster than a supercomputer Cray-2 and about as fast as the fastest computer in the world in 1993, NEC SX-3. Of course, some lovely things require a lot of computing power: HD video, lossless audio compression, real-time raytracing, and strong encryption. But plenty of tasks like reading, text editing and home budgeting don't have to need more than a fraction of this performance.

**How can we save energy and rare metals now used for wasteful computing?**

## ...while we could save our limited resources with computers...
We might treat computers as though they're expendable, but they are vital for us.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of areas of human lives that today can seriously suffer without computers:
* Communications: mobile networks and digital phone stations
* Information distribution: radio and television, printing, Internet
* Knowledge preservation: photography, computer storage systems, Wikipedia
* Engineering: computer-aided design systems (CAD), measuring tools
* Mass production: data acquisition systems, numerical control machining tools (CNC), industrial robotics
* Transportation: engine control systems
* Healthcare: diagnostic systems

Access to computers (or lack thereof) can make a massive difference in the quality of life of individuals, communities and countries. Unfortunately, despite widespread cheap computing devices, general-purpose computers are rare in poor and isolated regions. An RFID bus ticket might be as powerful as Altair 8800, but you cannot use it as a personal computer.

**How can we make our computers more accessible and versatile?**

## ...but we don't really know how computers work
The computers we use are so complex they are beyond a single person's comprehension level. They cannot be reproduced or repaired without pre-existing advanced computers and extensive expert knowledge. Worse, even once-popular computers often cannot be even _used_ without know-how, which is either obscure or completely lost by now. It is frightening that by now, even _computer engineers with university degrees_ find the foundations of computer science and hardware too complicated to be bothered to understand. So, when running an actual computer system, it is common to rely on incomplete documentation, tribal knowledge, past experiences, logical reasoning, and pure luck.

**How can we preserve the practical knowledge about digital computing?**

## If permacomputing is the answer, then Flourish PC is _an_ answer
You may have never heard the word "permacomputing" before. Don't worry. We didn't hear this word until we started working on this project, either.

As [defined by Devine Lu Linvega](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html), permacomputing is a sustainable computing approach. Permacomputing consists of:
* frugal computing (treating computing resources as precious),
* salvage computing (relying on existing resources), and
* collapse computing (utilising the computing resources that survived the collapse of production).
These branches of permacomputing might be the answers to the questions we posed earlier.

Flourish PC is a framework for building functional, practical, accessible, and simple personal computers; a framework for permacomputers, in other words. If this is what you're looking for, then this project can be helpful for you.
