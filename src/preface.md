# Preface

## Computers are everywhere
Computers have changed human civilisation. We depend on them, as we use them in almost every aspect of our daily lives and production cycles. Today, in 2022, it is not uncommon to use computers to power toothbrushes or single-use train tickets. Therefore, computers are vital to us, yet we treat them as though they're expendable.

The humanity will probably do fine without electric toothbrushes and CPU-powered pregnancy tests. But here is a non-exhaustive list of areas of human lives that today can seriously suffer without computers:
* Communications: mobile networks and digital phone stations
* Information distribution: radio and television, printing, Internet
* Knowledge preservation: photography, computer storage systems, Wikipedia
* Engineering: computer-aided design systems (CAD), measuring tools
* Mass production: data acquisition systems, numerical control machining tools (CNC), industrial robotics
* Transportation: engine control systems
* Healthcare: diagnostic systems

To make things worse, the computers we use are so complex they are beyond a single person's comprehension level. They cannot be reproduced (and often used) without pre-existing advanced computers and extensive expert knowledge.

Surely, it is not a big deal? Well... We think there are at least a few reasons to consider changing the current situation.

### "Sudden crisis" scenarios
While collecting an exhaustive list of realistic threats to computing is not a goal of this project, we think it's essential to provide at least some examples. You might find those in the "External links" section below. Naturally, there are countermeasures to these threats. But what if these countermeasures fail?

* Most advanced computer technologies are proprietary. A targeted attack on such a technology might cause a falling dominoes effect. Permanent damage to strategically important plants such as TSMC and Intel might leave the planet without essential chips.
* A war or a natural disaster might cut off an entire country's access to information and imports.
* An economic crisis might leave you without digital components for your cars, tractors and factories.
* A planet-scale catastrophe similar to Carrington Event at scale could disrupt global supply and production chains so severely that the whole civilisation will collapse.

### The spring has never come here
If you live in a poorer or an isolated (e.g. by censorship) country, you might have no general-purpose computing devices lying around.
* Options for education and research are going to be severely limited.
* Anything but simple mechanical and electrical designs will be unattainable or very expensive.
* Self-replicating technologies like 3D printers are beyond your reach.
